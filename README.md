Three national U.S. soil point datasets — NCSS Characterization Database, the National Soil Information System (NASIS), and the Rapid Carbon Assessment (RaCA) datasets — were combined with remote sensing images and detailed conventional soil polygon maps, and used to generate complete-coverage gridded predictions of soil properties (percent organic carbon, total nitrogen, bulk density, pH, and percent sand and clay) and classes (taxonomic great group and particle size in the control section) for the Conterminous U.S.
